It is my second repository on Sleep, Health, Lifestyle analysis.

Data Description

The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset has 400 rows and 13 columns,

It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep,
physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, 
daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.
